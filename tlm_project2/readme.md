## TLM PROJECT | Heart Disease Prediction

Level of difficulty: 4/10
Date: 10/2019
Datasets: heart1.csv, heart2.csv

**www.thelearningmachine.ai**

In this project, you will build a model that **predicts (a probability of) a heart disease of a patient**.

*The project contains 7 sections in total, each with step-by-step instructions of what to do. Note that, as we go further with our lessons, we will try to step away from guided projects like this to "less-guided", with less intructions involved. Thus, my advice is try to understand why we do what we do in what order.*

The 7 sections are as follows:
1. Import the Libratries
2. Import the Datasets
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Data Overview
5. Model Building
6. Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Conculsion

## Requirements
- knowledge of **syntax** *(e.g. for/while loops and if statements)*
- knowledge of **pandas** in data preprocessing *(e.g. delete/insert column, change column name, slice/filter/merge/split a table etc.)*
- knowledge of **data types** *(e.g. object/string/int/float)*
- jupyter notebook (tlm_project_1.ipynb)
