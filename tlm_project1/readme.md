## TLM PROJECT | Car Price Prediction - 09/2019

- Level of difficulty: 1/10
- Date: 09/2019
- Datasets: automobile_data1.csv, automobile_data2.csv, automobile_data3.csv

www.thelearningmachine.ai

In this project, you will build a model that **predicts a car price based on a certain independent variables**.

*The project contains 6 sections in total, each with step-by-step instructions of what to do. Note that, as we go further with our lessons, we will try to step away from guided projects like this to "less-guided", with less intructions involved. Thus, my advice is try to understand why we do what we do in what order.*

The 6 sections are as follows:
1. Import the Libratries
2. Import the datasets
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Data Overview
5. Model Building
6. Conclusion

## Requirements
- knowledge of **syntax** *(e.g. for/while loops and if statements)*
- knowledge of **pandas** in data preprocessing *(e.g. delete/insert column, change column name, slice/filter/merge/split a table etc.)*
- knowledge of **data types** *(e.g. object/string/int/float)*
- jupyter notebook (tlm_project_1.ipynb)
